Logistics:
    Each <supply node> creates a network.
        Within that network, supply trips are free.
        Supply quantities are individual to each... node?
    roads are required to connect each node

Trade Route:
    Each stop/node has an load quantity (LQT) 'N'
    May have 'M' transports associated with it.
    load qty is associated with a specific trade route
    positive LQT
        transfer from node to transport
        will transfer until transport has 'N' onboard
    negative LQT
        will transfer from ship to node
        will transfer until Node has 'N'


Simcity-Like Zoning
   "Fluid fields"
       Allocation:
           by single tile basis
           fields may be 'painted' in
           auto-laydown

       utitilization
           X tiles are required for 100% utilization
           any tile within y distance is available
           a tile may only be worked once


Resource Throttling:
    Ability to limit automatic consumption
        by resource units / minute
        by citizens of a given tier
